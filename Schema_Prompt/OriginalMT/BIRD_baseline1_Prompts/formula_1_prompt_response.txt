You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.


Example Queries
Question 1: Which constructor had the highest number of wins in the 2021 season?

sql
Copy code
SELECT C.name AS Constructor, COUNT(R.position) AS Wins
FROM results AS R
JOIN races AS Ra ON R.raceId = Ra.raceId
JOIN constructors AS C ON R.constructorId = C.constructorId
WHERE R.position = 1 AND Ra.year = 2021
GROUP BY C.name
ORDER BY Wins DESC
LIMIT 1;
Description:

Joins: Connects results, races, and constructors to link race results with constructors.
Filter: Considers only 2021 races where a constructor finished first.
Aggregation: Counts the number of wins per constructor.
Order and Limit: Retrieves the constructor with the most wins.
Question 2: What was the fastest lap speed in the Monaco Grand Prix in 2023?

sql
Copy code
SELECT MAX(CAST(R.fastestLapSpeed AS REAL)) AS FastestSpeed
FROM results AS R
JOIN races AS Ra ON R.raceId = Ra.raceId
WHERE Ra.name = 'Monaco Grand Prix' AND Ra.year = 2023;
Description:

Joins: Connects results and races to identify the Monaco Grand Prix in 2023.
Filter: Limits the query to the specific race.
Aggregation: Calculates the maximum fastest lap speed.
Question 3: Which driver completed the most laps across all races in 2022?

sql
Copy code
SELECT D.forename || ' ' || D.surname AS Driver, SUM(R.laps) AS TotalLaps
FROM results AS R
JOIN drivers AS D ON R.driverId = D.driverId
JOIN races AS Ra ON R.raceId = Ra.raceId
WHERE Ra.year = 2022
GROUP BY D.driverId, D.forename, D.surname
ORDER BY TotalLaps DESC
LIMIT 1;
Description:

Joins: Links results, drivers, and races to track laps completed by each driver in 2022.
Aggregation: Sums the total laps for each driver.
Order and Limit: Retrieves the driver with the highest total laps.
Query Writing Best Practices
Use Aliases: Simplify table and column references (e.g., results AS R).
Filter Precisely: Use WHERE clauses to narrow down results based on conditions.
Aggregate Effectively: Apply functions like SUM, COUNT, MAX, and AVG to extract insights.
Sort and Limit: Use ORDER BY and LIMIT to control the output.
Join Tables: Utilize joins to combine relevant data across tables.

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
