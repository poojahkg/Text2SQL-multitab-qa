Prompt
You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.

Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(a.atom_id) AS atom_count
FROM atom a
JOIN molecule m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id
WHERE m.label = 'Water';
Question: What types of bonds are present in the molecule with ID "mol123"?
Solution: Join the bond and molecule tables, filter by molecule_id = 'mol123', and select distinct bond_type.

Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT b.bond_type
FROM bond b
JOIN molecule m ON b.molecule_id = m.molecule_id
WHERE m.molecule_id = 'mol123';
Task
Using the schema and the example queries as a reference, construct a query for the following question:


Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
