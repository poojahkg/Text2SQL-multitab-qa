You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.


Use Joins Efficiently: Leverage joins to connect related tables via foreign keys.
Filter Data Precisely: Use WHERE clauses to filter rows and focus on relevant data.
Use Aliases: Simplify table and column references with aliases for better readability.
Aggregate Data When Necessary: Use functions like SUM, COUNT, or AVG for summary statistics.
Group and Order Data: Use GROUP BY and ORDER BY to organize and rank results.
Limit Results: Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows in output when appropriate.
Example Queries:
Question 1: How many superheroes have "super strength" as a superpower?
sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT hp.hero_id) AS SuperheroCount
FROM Hero_Power AS hp
JOIN Superpower AS sp ON hp.power_id = sp.id
WHERE sp.power_name = 'super strength';
Explanation:

Join: Connects Hero_Power with Superpower to filter by superpower name.
Filter: Restricts results to rows where the power name is "super strength".
Count: Counts unique superhero IDs using COUNT(DISTINCT hp.hero_id).
Question 2: What is the average height of all female superheroes published by Marvel?
sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(sh.height_cm) AS AverageHeight
FROM Superhero AS sh
JOIN Gender AS g ON sh.gender_id = g.id
JOIN Publisher AS p ON sh.publisher_id = p.id
WHERE g.gender = 'Female' AND p.publisher_name = 'Marvel';
Explanation:

Join: Connects Superhero with Gender and Publisher to filter by gender and publisher.
Filter: Limits the results to female superheroes from Marvel.
Aggregate: Calculates the average height using AVG.
Question 3: Which superhero has the highest intelligence attribute?
sql
Copy code
SELECT sh.superhero_name, ha.attribute_value AS Intelligence
FROM Hero_Attribute AS ha
JOIN Superhero AS sh ON ha.hero_id = sh.id
JOIN Attribute AS a ON ha.attribute_id = a.id
WHERE a.attribute_name = 'intelligence'
ORDER BY ha.attribute_value DESC
LIMIT 1;
Explanation:

Join: Links Hero_Attribute, Superhero, and Attribute to retrieve intelligence attributes.
Filter: Restricts results to the "intelligence" attribute.
Order: Sorts by attribute_value in descending order to find the highest value.
Limit: Returns only the top result using LIMIT 1.
Question 4: List the top 3 publishers with the most superheroes.
sql
Copy code
SELECT p.publisher_name, COUNT(sh.id) AS SuperheroCount
FROM Superhero AS sh
JOIN Publisher AS p ON sh.publisher_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.publisher_name
ORDER BY SuperheroCount DESC
LIMIT 3;
Explanation:

Join: Links Superhero with Publisher to count superheroes per publisher.
Group: Aggregates data by publisher name.
Order: Sorts publishers by superhero count in descending order.
Limit: Restricts the output to the top 3 publishers.


Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
