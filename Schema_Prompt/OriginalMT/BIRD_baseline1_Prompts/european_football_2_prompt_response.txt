sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(PA.overall_rating) AS AverageOverallRating
FROM Player_Attributes AS PA
JOIN Match AS M ON PA.date = M.date
JOIN League AS L ON M.league_id = L.id
WHERE L.name = 'Premier League' AND M.season = '2015';

Question 2: Which team had the highest average build-up play speed in the 2014-2015 season?

sql
Copy code
SELECT T.team_long_name, AVG(TA.buildUpPlaySpeed) AS AvgBuildUpPlaySpeed
FROM Team_Attributes AS TA
JOIN Team AS T ON TA.team_api_id = T.team_api_id
WHERE TA.date BETWEEN '2014-07-01' AND '2015-06-30'
GROUP BY T.team_long_name
ORDER BY AvgBuildUpPlaySpeed DESC
LIMIT 1;
Description:

This query identifies the team with the highest average buildUpPlaySpeed during the 2014-2015 season.
Joins: Links Team_Attributes and Team tables.
Filters: Considers attributes recorded between July 1, 2014, and June 30, 2015.
Grouping and Sorting: Groups by team and orders results by the average build-up play speed in descending order.
Question 3: How many matches ended in a draw during the 2013-2014 season?

Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS DrawMatches
FROM Match
WHERE home_team_goal = away_team_goal
  AND season = '2013/2014';
Description:

This query counts the number of matches that ended in a draw during the 2013-2014 season.
Filters: Compares home_team_goal and away_team_goal to identify draws, and limits the season to 2013/2014.
Instructions for Writing Queries
Use JOINs to combine data from multiple tables.
Apply GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses for aggregation and sorting.
Include LIMIT clauses to restrict results when needed.
Use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results if necessary.
Always ensure WHERE clauses accurately filter data based on conditions provided in the question.

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
