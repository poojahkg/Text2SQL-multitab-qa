You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.


Example Queries
Question 1: What is the average loan amount for accounts in districts with over 50,000 inhabitants?

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(L.amount) AS AvgLoanAmount
FROM loan AS L
JOIN account AS A ON L.account_id = A.account_id
JOIN district AS D ON A.district_id = D.district_id
WHERE D.number_of_inhabitants > 50000;
Description:

This query calculates the average loan amount for loans issued to accounts in districts with a population exceeding 50,000.
Joins: Links loan, account, and district tables.
Filters: Ensures only districts with more than 50,000 inhabitants are considered.
Question 2: How many transactions in March 1997 were made using accounts with a "monthly" transaction frequency?

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TransactionCount
FROM transaction AS T
JOIN account AS A ON T.account_id = A.account_id
WHERE A.frequency = 'monthly' AND T.date BETWEEN '1997-03-01' AND '1997-03-31';
Description:

This query counts all transactions in March 1997 for accounts with a "monthly" transaction frequency.
Joins: Connects transaction and account tables.
Filters: Ensures transactions are within March 1997 and linked to accounts with the "monthly" frequency.
Question 3: Which district had the highest average account balance after transactions in 1996?

sql
Copy code
SELECT D.district_name, AVG(T.balance) AS AvgBalance
FROM transaction AS T
JOIN account AS A ON T.account_id = A.account_id
JOIN district AS D ON A.district_id = D.district_id
WHERE T.date BETWEEN '1996-01-01' AND '1996-12-31'
GROUP BY D.district_name
ORDER BY AvgBalance DESC
LIMIT 1;
Description:

This query finds the district with the highest average account balance after transactions in 1996.
Joins: Links transaction, account, and district tables.
Grouping and Sorting: Groups results by district and orders them by average balance in descending order.
Limit: Restricts the result to the top district.
Instructions for Writing Queries
Use JOIN to combine data across multiple tables when necessary.
Apply GROUP BY for aggregation and use ORDER BY to sort results.
Utilize LIMIT to restrict the output to a specific number of rows.
Use WHERE clauses to filter data based on given conditions (e.g., date ranges, specific types).

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
