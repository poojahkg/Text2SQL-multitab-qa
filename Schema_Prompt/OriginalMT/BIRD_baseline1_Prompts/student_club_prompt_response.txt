Prompt
You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.


Example Queries:
Question 1: What was the total amount spent on expenses related to the "Fall Festival" event?

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(E.cost) AS TotalSpent
FROM Expense AS E
JOIN Budget AS B ON E.link_to_budget = B.budget_id
JOIN Event AS EV ON B.link_to_event = EV.event_id
WHERE EV.event_name = 'Fall Festival';
Explanation:

Joins: Connects Expense, Budget, and Event tables using foreign keys.
Filter: Retrieves expenses associated with the event "Fall Festival".
Aggregation: Sums the cost column to calculate the total amount spent.
Question 2: How many members are in the "Computer Science" major?

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS MemberCount
FROM Member AS M
JOIN Major AS MA ON M.link_to_major = MA.major_id
WHERE MA.major_name = 'Computer Science';
Explanation:

Join: Links Member and Major tables to associate members with their majors.
Filter: Focuses on members in the "Computer Science" major.
Aggregation: Counts the total number of members in the specified major.
Question 3: Which zip codes have members who attended more than 3 events?

sql
Copy code
SELECT Z.zip_code, Z.city, COUNT(A.link_to_event) AS EventCount
FROM Attendance AS A
JOIN Member AS M ON A.link_to_member = M.member_id
JOIN Zip_Code AS Z ON M.zip = Z.zip_code
GROUP BY Z.zip_code, Z.city
HAVING COUNT(A.link_to_event) > 3;
Explanation:

Joins: Combines Attendance, Member, and Zip_Code tables to link events attended by members to their zip codes.
Aggregation: Counts the number of events attended per zip code.
Filter: Retrieves zip codes where members attended more than 3 events.


Query Writing Best Practices
Use Aliases: Simplify table and column references (e.g., results AS R).
Filter Precisely: Use WHERE clauses to narrow down results based on conditions.
Aggregate Effectively: Apply functions like SUM, COUNT, MAX, and AVG to extract insights.
Sort and Limit: Use ORDER BY and LIMIT to control the output.
Join Tables: Utilize joins to combine relevant data across tables.

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
