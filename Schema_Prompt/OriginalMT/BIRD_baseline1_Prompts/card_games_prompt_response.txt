Prompt
You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.


Few-Shot Examples
Question 1: How many cards from the "Dominaria" set are legal in the "Commander" format?
sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS LegalCardsInCommander
FROM cards
JOIN legalities ON cards.uuid = legalities.uuid
WHERE cards.setCode = 'DOM' AND legalities.format = 'Commander' AND legalities.status = 'Legal';
Description: This query counts the number of cards in the "Dominaria" set that are legal in the "Commander" format. A JOIN connects the cards and legalities tables, and filtering is done on setCode, format, and status.
Question 2: List the top 5 most recent sets, including their release date.
sql
Copy code
SELECT name AS SetName, releaseDate
FROM sets
ORDER BY releaseDate DESC
LIMIT 5;
Description: This query retrieves the top 5 most recent sets by their release date. The ORDER BY clause sorts the sets in descending order by releaseDate, and LIMIT restricts the output to 5 rows.
Question 3: What are the unique languages in which the card "Black Lotus" has foreign flavor text?
sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT foreign_data.language
FROM cards
JOIN foreign_data ON cards.uuid = foreign_data.uuid
WHERE cards.name = 'Black Lotus';
Description: This query retrieves the distinct languages in which the card "Black Lotus" has foreign flavor text. A JOIN connects the cards and foreign_data tables, and filtering is done by the card's name.

Instructions for Writing Queries
Use JOINs to combine data from multiple tables.
Apply GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses for aggregation and sorting.
Include LIMIT clauses to restrict results when needed.
Use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results if necessary.
Always ensure WHERE clauses accurately filter data based on conditions provided in the question.
Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
