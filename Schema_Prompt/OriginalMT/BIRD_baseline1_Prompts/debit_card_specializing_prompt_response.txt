Prompt
You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.


Few-Shot Examples
Question 1: What is the total consumption for each customer in the year 2024?
sql
Copy code
SELECT CustomerID, SUM(Consumption) AS TotalConsumption
FROM year_and_month
WHERE Date LIKE '2024-%'
GROUP BY CustomerID;
Description:

This query calculates the total consumption for each customer in 2024.
The WHERE clause filters rows to include only dates in 2024 using the LIKE operator.
The SUM function aggregates consumption, and GROUP BY organizes results by customer ID.
Question 2: Which gas station generated the highest revenue in May 2024?
sql
Copy code
SELECT T2.GasStationID, SUM(T1.Amount) AS TotalRevenue
FROM transactions AS T1
JOIN gas_stations AS T2 ON T1.GasStationID = T2.GasStationID
WHERE T1.Date BETWEEN '2024-05-01' AND '2024-05-31'
GROUP BY T2.GasStationID
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
Description:

This query identifies the gas station with the highest revenue in May 2024.
A JOIN connects the transactions and gas stations tables.
The WHERE clause filters transactions within May 2024, and SUM calculates total revenue.
The ORDER BY clause sorts results by revenue in descending order, with LIMIT 1 returning the top gas station.
Question 3: What is the average amount spent per transaction by customers in the "Urban" gas station segment?
sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(T1.Amount) AS AvgAmountSpent
FROM transactions AS T1
JOIN gas_stations AS T2 ON T1.GasStationID = T2.GasStationID
WHERE T2.Segment = 'Urban';
Description:

This query calculates the average amount spent per transaction in "Urban" gas stations.
A JOIN connects the transactions and gas stations tables.
The WHERE clause filters for gas stations with the "Urban" segment.
The AVG function computes the average transaction amount.

Instructions for Writing Queries
Use JOINs to combine data from multiple tables.
Apply GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses for aggregation and sorting.
Include LIMIT clauses to restrict results when needed.
Use DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results if necessary.
Always ensure WHERE clauses accurately filter data based on conditions provided in the question.
Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
