Prompt
You are tasked with writing a query to solve a specific problem based on the schema and instructions below. Follow the step-by-step process to construct the query.

Use Joins Wisely: Utilize foreign keys to join related tables.
Filter Effectively: Apply WHERE clauses to narrow down results to relevant data.
Aggregate Appropriately: Use aggregation functions (AVG, SUM, COUNT) for summary statistics.
Optimize with Aliases: Use table aliases (AS) for readability and concise queries.
Order and Limit Results: Apply ORDER BY and LIMIT to organize or restrict output.
Example Queries:
Question 1: How many patients had a positive result for anti-Cardiolipin antibody (IgG) above 20?
sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ex.ID) AS PositivePatients
FROM Examination AS ex
WHERE ex.aCL_IgG > 20;
Explanation:

Filter: Restricts results to rows where aCL_IgG > 20.
Count: Uses COUNT(DISTINCT ex.ID) to count unique patients.
Question 2: What is the average level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients diagnosed with thrombosis?
sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(lab.CRP) AS AvgCRP
FROM Laboratory AS lab
JOIN Examination AS ex ON lab.ID = ex.ID
WHERE ex.Thrombosis = 1;
Explanation:

Join: Connects Laboratory and Examination tables via the patient ID (ID).
Filter: Limits to rows where Thrombosis = 1.
Aggregate: Calculates the average CRP level using AVG.
Question 3: List the top 5 patients with the highest WBC count along with their diagnosis.
sql
Copy code
SELECT p.ID, p.Diagnosis, lab.WBC
FROM Patient AS p
JOIN Laboratory AS lab ON p.ID = lab.ID
ORDER BY lab.WBC DESC
LIMIT 5;
Explanation:

Join: Links Patient and Laboratory tables to retrieve WBC and diagnosis.
Order: Sorts by WBC in descending order.
Limit: Restricts results to the top 5 rows.
Question 4: How many examinations were conducted on patients born before 1970?
sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ExamCount
FROM Examination AS ex
JOIN Patient AS p ON ex.ID = p.ID
WHERE p.Birthday < '1970-01-01';
Explanation:

Join: Connects Examination and Patient tables.
Filter: Restricts results to patients born before 1970.
Count: Uses COUNT(*) to count examinations.

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
