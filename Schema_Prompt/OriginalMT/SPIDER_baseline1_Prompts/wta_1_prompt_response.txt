This database schema tracks tennis match results and player rankings. The schema consists of four tables:

Understand the Schema:

Determine relationships between tables (e.g., matches links to players via winner_id and loser_id).
Analyze the Question:

Identify which tables and columns are necessary.
Determine whether filters, grouping, or aggregations are required.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to connect tables.
Use DISTINCT to filter unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict rows in the result.
Use subqueries for intermediate calculations.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) when necessary.
Write and Validate the Query:

Ensure the query is logically structured and accurate.
Test for completeness and correctness.
Few-Shot Examples
Example 1:
Question: How many tournaments did player with player_id 5 participate in during 2022?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tourney_id) AS Tournaments_Played
FROM matches
WHERE winner_id = 5 OR loser_id = 5
AND strftime('%Y', tourney_date) = '2022';
Example 2:
Question: Find the names of all players who lost in the final round of any tournament.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM players p
JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.loser_id
WHERE m.round = 'F';
Example 3:
Question: Which surface (e.g., 'Clay', 'Hard') has the highest average match duration?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT surface, AVG(minutes) AS Avg_Duration
FROM matches
GROUP BY surface
ORDER BY Avg_Duration DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 4:
Question: List the top 5 most successful players based on the total matches won.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, COUNT(m.match_num) AS Matches_Won
FROM players p
JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.winner_id
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
ORDER BY Matches_Won DESC
LIMIT 5;
Example 5:
Question: Find the average ranking of players who reached the semi-finals ('SF') in tournaments held on grass courts.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(winner_rank) AS Avg_Ranking
FROM matches
WHERE round = 'SF' AND surface = 'Grass';
Example 6:
Question: List all players who have participated in both qualifying matches and main matches.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM players p
WHERE p.player_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT winner_id FROM matches
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT winner_id FROM qualifying_matches
);
Example 7:
Question: Find the youngest player to ever win a match.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, MIN(m.winner_age) AS Youngest_Winner_Age
FROM players p
JOIN matches m ON p.player_id = m.winner_id
WHERE m.winner_age IS NOT NULL;
Example 8:
Question: What is the total number of ranking points accumulated by players from Spain ('ESP') in 2023?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(r.ranking_points) AS Total_Points
FROM rankings r
JOIN players p ON r.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE p.country_code = 'ESP' AND strftime('%Y', r.ranking_date) = '2023';
Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
