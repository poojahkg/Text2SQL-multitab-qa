Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema:

Identify the relationships between tables using foreign keys.
Understand how flights links airlines and airports.
Analyze the Question:

Determine which tables are relevant.
Identify filtering conditions, aggregations, or joins required to extract the data.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to combine data across tables.
Use DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate results.
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned.
Use subqueries for filtering or aggregating intermediate results.
Apply grouping (GROUP BY) and aggregation (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG) as needed.
Write and Validate the Query:

Structure the query logically step by step.
Test to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: List all unique destinations served by flights operated by "Delta Airlines."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT a.AirportName AS Destination
FROM flights f
JOIN airlines al ON f.Airline = al.uid
JOIN airports a ON f.DestAirport = a.AirportCode
WHERE al.Airline = 'Delta Airlines';
Example 2:
Question: Find the total number of flights operated by airlines based in "United States."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM flights f
JOIN airlines al ON f.Airline = al.uid
WHERE al.Country = 'United States';
Example 3:
Question: What are the top 3 busiest source airports based on the number of departing flights?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT a.AirportName AS Source_Airport, COUNT(f.FlightNo) AS Departing_Flights
FROM flights f
JOIN airports a ON f.SourceAirport = a.AirportCode
GROUP BY a.AirportName
ORDER BY Departing_Flights DESC
LIMIT 3;
Example 4:
Question: How many flights operate between "JFK International Airport" and "Los Angeles International Airport"?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM flights f
JOIN airports a1 ON f.SourceAirport = a1.AirportCode
JOIN airports a2 ON f.DestAirport = a2.AirportCode
WHERE a1.AirportName = 'JFK International Airport' AND a2.AirportName = 'Los Angeles International Airport';
Example 5:
Question: Which airline operates the highest number of flights?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT al.Airline, COUNT(f.FlightNo) AS Flight_Count
FROM flights f
JOIN airlines al ON f.Airline = al.uid
GROUP BY al.Airline
ORDER BY Flight_Count DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 6:
Question: List all flights departing from airports in "Canada."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT f.FlightNo, al.Airline, a.AirportName AS Source_Airport
FROM flights f
JOIN airports a ON f.SourceAirport = a.AirportCode
JOIN airlines al ON f.Airline = al.uid
WHERE a.Country = 'Canada';
Example 7:
Question: What is the average number of flights operated per airline?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(Flight_Count) AS Average_Flights_Per_Airline
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(f.FlightNo) AS Flight_Count
    FROM flights f
    GROUP BY f.Airline
) AS Flight_Data;


Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
