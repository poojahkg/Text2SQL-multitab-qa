Instructions for Writing Queries:
Understand the Relationships: Review the schema and identify the foreign key relationships between tables.
Analyze the Question: Break down the question into smaller steps to identify the required tables and filters.
Use Appropriate SQL Techniques: Depending on the question, incorporate techniques such as:
JOIN to combine data across tables.
DISTINCT to remove duplicates.
LIMIT to restrict the number of rows in the result.
Subqueries or nested queries for filtering or aggregations.
Write the Query Step-by-Step: Ensure the query is syntactically correct and solves the given problem.
Test for Clarity and Completeness: Verify the query covers all parts of the question and retrieves the desired results.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries:
Example 1:
Question: List the unique car makers that have models weighing over 3000 pounds.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT cm.Maker
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
JOIN car_names cn ON ml.ModelId = cn.Model
JOIN cars_data cd ON cn.MakeId = cd.Id
WHERE cd.Weight > 3000;
Example 2:
Question: What is the average MPG of cars made by manufacturers based in Asia?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(CAST(cd.MPG AS REAL)) AS avg_mpg
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
JOIN model_list ml ON cn.Model = ml.ModelId
JOIN car_makers cm ON ml.Maker = cm.Id
JOIN countries c ON cm.Country = c.CountryId
JOIN continents co ON c.Continent = co.ContId
WHERE co.Continent = 'Asia';
Example 3:
Question: Find the top 5 car models with the highest horsepower in 2021.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT cn.Model, CAST(cd.Horsepower AS REAL) AS horsepower
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE cd.Year = 2021
ORDER BY horsepower DESC
LIMIT 5;
Example 4:
Question: Which car maker produces the most models in Europe?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT cm.Maker, COUNT(ml.ModelId) AS model_count
FROM car_makers cm
JOIN model_list ml ON cm.Id = ml.Maker
JOIN countries c ON cm.Country = c.CountryId
JOIN continents co ON c.Continent = co.ContId
WHERE co.Continent = 'Europe'
GROUP BY cm.Maker
ORDER BY model_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 5:
Question: What are the names of all car models with MPG greater than the average MPG across all cars?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT cn.Model
FROM cars_data cd
JOIN car_names cn ON cd.Id = cn.MakeId
WHERE CAST(cd.MPG AS REAL) > (
    SELECT AVG(CAST(MPG AS REAL)) FROM cars_data
);


Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
