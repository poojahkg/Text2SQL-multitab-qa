This database schema tracks city information, including demographics and geographical details. The schema consists of a single table:


Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema:

The city table is the main data source, containing fields for city names, country codes, districts, and populations.
Analyze the Question:

Identify which fields are needed to answer the query.
Determine whether filters, aggregations, or ordering are required.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN when combining tables (if additional related tables exist).
Use DISTINCT to retrieve unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict rows in the output.
Use subqueries for filtering or intermediate calculations.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) when necessary.
Write and Validate the Query:

Structure the query logically and ensure it is syntactically correct.
Test the query for completeness and accuracy.
Few-Shot Examples
Example 1:
Question: What is the name of the city with the smallest population in India (CountryCode = 'IND')?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name 
FROM city 
WHERE CountryCode = 'IND' 
ORDER BY Population ASC 
LIMIT 1;
Example 2:
Question: List all districts with at least 1,000,000 total population across their cities.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT District, SUM(Population) AS Total_Population 
FROM city 
GROUP BY District 
HAVING SUM(Population) >= 1000000;
Example 3:
Question: How many unique countries are represented in the city table?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CountryCode) AS Unique_Countries 
FROM city;
Example 4:
Question: Find the average population of cities in districts starting with "S."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(Population) AS Average_Population 
FROM city 
WHERE District LIKE 'S%';
Example 5:
Question: Which country has the most cities in the database?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT CountryCode, COUNT(*) AS City_Count 
FROM city 
GROUP BY CountryCode 
ORDER BY City_Count DESC 
LIMIT 1;
Example 6:
Question: Find all cities in the district with the highest total population.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name 
FROM city 
WHERE District = (
    SELECT District 
    FROM city 
    GROUP BY District 
    ORDER BY SUM(Population) DESC 
    LIMIT 1
);
Example 7:
Question: What is the total population of cities in the top 5 most populous countries?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(Population) AS Total_Population 
FROM city 
WHERE CountryCode IN (
    SELECT CountryCode 
    FROM city 
    GROUP BY CountryCode 
    ORDER BY SUM(Population) DESC 
    LIMIT 5
);
Example 8:
Question: List the names of all cities with a population higher than the average population of all cities in the database.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Name 
FROM city 
WHERE Population > (SELECT AVG(Population) FROM city);

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
