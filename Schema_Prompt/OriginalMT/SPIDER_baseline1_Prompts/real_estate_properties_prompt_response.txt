Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema:

The Properties table is the main table containing property details.
Use Ref_Property_Types to understand the property type codes.
Use Other_Available_Features and Other_Property_Features to link properties to their features.
Use Ref_Feature_Types for categorizing feature types.
Analyze the Question:

Determine which tables and fields are required.
Identify any filtering, grouping, or aggregation needed to answer the question.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to combine related tables.
Use DISTINCT to filter unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows in the output.
Use subqueries for intermediate calculations or filtering.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, AVG, etc.) when needed.
Write and Validate the Query:

Structure the query logically, step by step.
Test for completeness and accuracy.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: List the names of all properties that have the feature "AirCon."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.property_name
FROM Properties p
JOIN Other_Property_Features opf ON p.property_id = opf.property_id
JOIN Other_Available_Features oaf ON opf.feature_id = oaf.feature_id
WHERE oaf.feature_name = 'AirCon';
Example 2:
Question: Find the average agreed selling price of all apartments.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(agreed_selling_price) AS Average_Selling_Price
FROM Properties
WHERE property_type_code = 'Apartment' AND agreed_selling_price IS NOT NULL;
Example 3:
Question: Which feature type has the most features available?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT rft.feature_type_name, COUNT(oaf.feature_id) AS Feature_Count
FROM Ref_Feature_Types rft
JOIN Other_Available_Features oaf ON rft.feature_type_code = oaf.feature_type_code
GROUP BY rft.feature_type_name
ORDER BY Feature_Count DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 4:
Question: List all unsold houses that were put on the market before 2023.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT property_name
FROM Properties
WHERE property_type_code = 'House' AND date_sold IS NULL AND date_on_market < '2023-01-01';
Example 5:
Question: Find the property with the highest vendor requested price.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT property_name, vendor_requested_price
FROM Properties
ORDER BY vendor_requested_price DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 6:
Question: How many properties have "Security" as a feature type?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opf.property_id) AS Property_Count
FROM Other_Property_Features opf
JOIN Other_Available_Features oaf ON opf.feature_id = oaf.feature_id
WHERE oaf.feature_type_code = 'Security';
Example 7:
Question: Which property type has the highest average agreed selling price?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT rpt.property_type_description, AVG(p.agreed_selling_price) AS Average_Selling_Price
FROM Properties p
JOIN Ref_Property_Types rpt ON p.property_type_code = rpt.property_type_code
WHERE p.agreed_selling_price IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY rpt.property_type_description
ORDER BY Average_Selling_Price DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 8:
Question: List all properties that have more than 3 features.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.property_name, COUNT(opf.feature_id) AS Feature_Count
FROM Properties p
JOIN Other_Property_Features opf ON p.property_id = opf.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.property_name
HAVING COUNT(opf.feature_id) > 3;

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
