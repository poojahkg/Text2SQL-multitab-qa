Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema: Identify the relationships between tables:
course is linked to course_arrange via Course_ID.
teacher is linked to course_arrange via Teacher_ID.
Analyze the Question: Break the query into smaller parts to determine the necessary tables and filtering conditions.
SQL Techniques:
Use JOIN to connect tables based on their relationships.
Use DISTINCT to retrieve unique results.
Use filtering conditions (WHERE) to narrow down data.
Use nested subqueries when specific filtering conditions require data from another query.
Apply grouping (GROUP BY) and aggregation (e.g., COUNT, AVG) where applicable.
Write and Validate the Query: Ensure it solves the problem step by step and is syntactically correct.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: List the names of teachers who teach Science to grade 5.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.Name
FROM teacher t
JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID
JOIN course c ON ca.Course_ID = c.Course_ID
WHERE c.Course = 'Science' AND ca.Grade = 5;
Example 2:
Question: How many courses does each teacher teach?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.Name, COUNT(ca.Course_ID) AS Course_Count
FROM teacher t
JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID
GROUP BY t.Name;
Example 3:
Question: Which courses start on or after June 1st?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT c.Course
FROM course c
WHERE CAST(c.Staring_Date AS DATE) >= '2023-06-01';
Example 4:
Question: What is the average grade level of all courses taught by teachers from "Springfield"?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(ca.Grade) AS Average_Grade
FROM teacher t
JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID
WHERE t.Hometown = 'Springfield';
Example 5:
Question: Find the youngest teacher who teaches a course named "History."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.Name, MIN(CAST(t.Age AS INT)) AS Youngest_Age
FROM teacher t
JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID
JOIN course c ON ca.Course_ID = c.Course_ID
WHERE c.Course = 'History';
Example 6:
Question: List the courses and grade levels taught by teacher "John Doe."
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT c.Course, ca.Grade
FROM teacher t
JOIN course_arrange ca ON t.Teacher_ID = ca.Teacher_ID
JOIN course c ON ca.Course_ID = c.Course_ID
WHERE t.Name = 'John Doe';
