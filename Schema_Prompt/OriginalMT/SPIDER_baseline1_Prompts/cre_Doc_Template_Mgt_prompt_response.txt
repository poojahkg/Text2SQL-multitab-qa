Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Relationships:
Identify the relationships between tables:
Templates is linked to Ref_Template_Types via Template_Type_Code.
Documents is linked to Templates via Template_ID.
Paragraphs is linked to Documents via Document_ID.
Break Down the Question:
Determine which tables and columns are relevant.
Identify filtering conditions, aggregation requirements, or specific fields to be selected.
Use SQL Techniques:
Use JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
Use subqueries for filtering or calculating intermediate results.
Apply DISTINCT for unique results, and LIMIT to restrict the number of rows.
Use functions like COUNT, AVG, or MAX for aggregations.
Write and Validate the Query: Ensure it answers the question step by step with correct syntax.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: How many documents were created from templates effective after January 1, 2023?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Document_Count
FROM Documents d
JOIN Templates t ON d.Template_ID = t.Template_ID
WHERE t.Date_Effective_From > '2023-01-01';
Example 2:
Question: List all paragraph texts from documents created using templates of type 'CV'.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.Paragraph_Text
FROM Paragraphs p
JOIN Documents d ON p.Document_ID = d.Document_ID
JOIN Templates t ON d.Template_ID = t.Template_ID
WHERE t.Template_Type_Code = 'CV';
Example 3:
Question: Find the template with the longest effective period (Date_Effective_To - Date_Effective_From).
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT Template_ID, MAX(DATEDIFF(Date_Effective_To, Date_Effective_From)) AS Longest_Effective_Period
FROM Templates;
Example 4:
Question: What is the total number of paragraphs across all documents created using templates of version 2?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(p.Paragraph_ID) AS Total_Paragraphs
FROM Paragraphs p
JOIN Documents d ON p.Document_ID = d.Document_ID
JOIN Templates t ON d.Template_ID = t.Template_ID
WHERE t.Version_Number = 2;
Example 5:
Question: List the descriptions of templates that have not been used to create any document.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.Template_Details
FROM Templates t
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM Documents d WHERE d.Template_ID = t.Template_ID
);
Example 6:
Question: List the names of documents that contain a paragraph with the word "important".
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT d.Document_Name
FROM Documents d
JOIN Paragraphs p ON d.Document_ID = p.Document_ID
WHERE p.Paragraph_Text LIKE '%important%';

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
