Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema:

The singer table contains information about singers such as their name, birth year, net worth, and citizenship.
The song table contains details about songs, including the singer's ID as a foreign key, sales, and chart performance.
Analyze the Question:

Determine which tables and fields are required to extract the data.
Identify any filtering, grouping, or aggregations needed.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to combine related tables.
Use DISTINCT to filter unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned.
Use subqueries for intermediate calculations or filtering.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, AVG, etc.) when needed.
Write and Validate the Query:

Structure the query logically step by step.
Test to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: List the titles of all songs by singers born before 1990.
Query:

sql
Copy code

Example 2:
Question: Find the song with the highest sales.
Query:

FROM song s
ORDER BY s.Sales DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 3:
Question: What is the average net worth of singers who have had a song reach the number 1 position on the charts?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(sg.Net_Worth_Millions) AS Average_Net_Worth
FROM singer sg
WHERE sg.Singer_ID IN (SELECT s.Singer_ID FROM song s WHERE s.Highest_Position = 1);
Example 4:
Question: List all singers with more than 5 songs.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT sg.Name, COUNT(s.Song_ID) AS Song_Count
FROM singer sg
JOIN song s ON sg.Singer_ID = s.Singer_ID
GROUP BY sg.Singer_ID, sg.Name
HAVING COUNT(s.Song_ID) > 5;
Example 5:
Question: Find the citizenship with the highest total song sales.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT sg.Citizenship, SUM(s.Sales) AS Total_Sales
