Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema:

Review the relationships:
orchestra links to conductor via Conductor_ID.
performance links to orchestra via Orchestra_ID.
show links to performance via Performance_ID.
Analyze the Question:

Identify the relevant tables and relationships required to extract the data.
Determine filtering conditions, grouping, or aggregation needed.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to combine related tables.
Use DISTINCT to filter unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows in the output.
Use subqueries for intermediate calculations or filtering.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, AVG) where applicable.
Write and Validate the Query:

Structure the query logically, step by step.
Test for accuracy and completeness.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: Find the names of all conductors who have worked for more than 20 years.

Example 3:
Question: What is the average attendance for shows in performances of type "Live final"?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(s.Attendance) AS Average_Attendance
FROM show s
JOIN performance p ON s.Performance_ID = p.Performance_ID
WHERE p.Type = 'Live final';
Example 4:
Question: Find the conductor with the most orchestras under their direction.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT c.Name, COUNT(o.Orchestra_ID) AS Orchestra_Count
FROM conductor c
JOIN orchestra o ON c.Conductor_ID = o.Conductor_ID
GROUP BY c.Conductor_ID, c.Name
ORDER BY Orchestra_Count DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 5:
Question: How many performances in 2022 had an official rating above 5 million?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS High_Rated_Performances
FROM performance
WHERE CAST(Date AS DATE) >= '2022-01-01' AND CAST(Date AS DATE) <= '2022-12-31'
AND Official_ratings_(millions) > 5;
Example 6:
Question: List all performances with their type and official ratings, sorted by market share.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.Type, p.Official_ratings_(millions), p.Share
FROM performance p
ORDER BY CAST(p.Share AS REAL) DESC;
Example 7:
Question: Find the total attendance for all first shows across all performances.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(s.Attendance) AS Total_First_Show_Attendance
FROM show s
WHERE s.If_first_show = TRUE;
Example 8:
Question: Which performance type had the highest average weekly rank?

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.Type, AVG(CAST(p.Weekly_rank AS REAL)) AS Average_Rank
FROM performance p
GROUP BY p.Type
ORDER BY Average_Rank ASC
LIMIT 1;
