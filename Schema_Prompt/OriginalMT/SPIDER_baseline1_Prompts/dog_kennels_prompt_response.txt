Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Relationships:

Review the schema and identify relationships between tables using foreign keys.
Use relevant tables to extract data based on the question.
Analyze the Question:

Determine the tables, fields, and filtering conditions needed to answer the question.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to combine data from multiple tables.
Use DISTINCT to retrieve unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows in the output.
Use subqueries for filtering or aggregating intermediate data.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG) where necessary.
Write and Validate the Query:

Ensure the query is logically structured and solves the given problem step by step.
Test for accuracy and completeness.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: List the names and breeds of all dogs treated in 2023.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT d.name AS Dog_Name, b.breed_name AS Breed
FROM Dogs d
JOIN Treatments t ON d.dog_id = t.dog_id
JOIN Breeds b ON d.breed_code = b.breed_code
WHERE YEAR(t.date_of_treatment) = 2023;
Example 2:
Question: Find the top 5 most expensive treatments provided in the facility.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT t.treatment_id, t.cost_of_treatment
FROM Treatments t
ORDER BY t.cost_of_treatment DESC
LIMIT 5;
Example 3:
Question: How many male dogs have been treated by veterinarians?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t.dog_id) AS Male_Dogs_Treated
FROM Treatments t
JOIN Dogs d ON t.dog_id = d.dog_id
JOIN Professionals p ON t.professional_id = p.professional_id
WHERE d.gender = '0' AND p.role_code = 'Veterenarian';
Example 4:
Question: What is the total cost of treatments for dogs of size 'MED'?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(t.cost_of_treatment) AS Total_Cost
FROM Treatments t
JOIN Dogs d ON t.dog_id = d.dog_id
WHERE d.size_code = 'MED';
Example 5:
Question: List all dog names and their owner's names for abandoned dogs.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT d.name AS Dog_Name, o.first_name AS Owner_First_Name, o.last_name AS Owner_Last_Name
FROM Dogs d
JOIN Owners o ON d.owner_id = o.owner_id
WHERE d.abandoned_yn = '1';
Example 6:
Question: Find the average cost of treatments provided by each veterinarian.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.first_name AS Veterinarian_First_Name, p.last_name AS Veterinarian_Last_Name, AVG(t.cost_of_treatment) AS Average_Treatment_Cost
FROM Treatments t
JOIN Professionals p ON t.professional_id = p.professional_id
WHERE p.role_code = 'Veterenarian'
GROUP BY p.professional_id;
Example 7:
Question: Which breeds of dogs have been treated with a "Vaccination" treatment?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT b.breed_name
FROM Treatments t
JOIN Dogs d ON t.dog_id = d.dog_id
JOIN Breeds b ON d.breed_code = b.breed_code
WHERE t.treatment_type_code = 'VAC';

Now, based on the schema and instructions above, think step by step and give me the final query. Here is your question:
