Instructions for Writing Queries
Understand the Schema:

AREA_CODE_STATE links area codes to states.
CONTESTANTS lists the participants in the contest.
VOTES records votes cast, linking voters to contestants and states.
Analyze the Question:

Identify which tables and columns are relevant.
Determine whether filtering, grouping, or aggregation is needed.
Use SQL Techniques:

Use JOIN to combine related tables.
Use DISTINCT to filter unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict rows.
Use subqueries for filtering or intermediate calculations.
Apply grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT, AVG, etc.) where applicable.
Write and Validate the Query:

Structure the query logically, step by step.
Test for completeness and accuracy.
Few-Shot Questions and Queries
Example 1:
Question: How many votes were cast for each contestant?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT c.contestant_name, COUNT(v.vote_id) AS Vote_Count
FROM CONTESTANTS c
JOIN VOTES v ON c.contestant_number = v.contestant_number
GROUP BY c.contestant_name
ORDER BY Vote_Count DESC;
Example 2:
Question: List the states from which votes were cast for contestant number 2.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT v.state
FROM VOTES v
WHERE v.contestant_number = 2;
Example 3:
Question: Find the contestant with the highest number of votes.
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT c.contestant_name, COUNT(v.vote_id) AS Total_Votes
FROM CONTESTANTS c
JOIN VOTES v ON c.contestant_number = v.contestant_number
GROUP BY c.contestant_name
ORDER BY Total_Votes DESC
LIMIT 1;
Example 4:
Question: How many votes were cast by area codes starting with '212'?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Vote_Count
FROM VOTES v
JOIN AREA_CODE_STATE acs ON SUBSTRING(v.phone_number::TEXT, 1, 3) = acs.area_code::TEXT
WHERE acs.area_code LIKE '212%';
Example 5:
Question: What is the total number of votes cast for contestants with more than 100 votes?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(Vote_Count) AS Total_Votes
FROM (
    SELECT v.contestant_number, COUNT(v.vote_id) AS Vote_Count
    FROM VOTES v
    GROUP BY v.contestant_number
    HAVING COUNT(v.vote_id) > 100
) AS Subquery;
Example 6:
Question: List all contestants who received votes from California (CA).
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT c.contestant_name
FROM CONTESTANTS c
JOIN VOTES v ON c.contestant_number = v.contestant_number
WHERE v.state = 'CA';
Example 7:
Question: What is the average number of votes per contestant?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT AVG(Vote_Count) AS Average_Votes
FROM (
    SELECT c.contestant_name, COUNT(v.vote_id) AS Vote_Count
    FROM CONTESTANTS c
    JOIN VOTES v ON c.contestant_number = v.contestant_number
    GROUP BY c.contestant_name
) AS Subquery;
Example 8:
Question: How many votes were cast on January 1, 2023?
Query:

sql
Copy code
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Votes_On_Jan1
FROM VOTES
WHERE created LIKE '2023-01-01%';
