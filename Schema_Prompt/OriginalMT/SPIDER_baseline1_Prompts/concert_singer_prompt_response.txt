Instructions for Writing Queries:
Understand the Relationships: Study the relationships between tables and identify how data is linked using foreign keys.
Analyze the Question: Break the question into smaller parts to determine the required data and operations (e.g., filtering, aggregation, joining).
SQL Techniques:
Use JOIN to combine related tables.
Use DISTINCT to filter unique results.
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows in the result.
Use nested subqueries for filtering or aggregating data.
Apply filtering conditions (e.g., WHERE) for specific criteria.
Write the Query: Construct the SQL query step by step, ensuring logical flow and syntax correctness.
Test the Query: Validate the query for accuracy and completeness.
