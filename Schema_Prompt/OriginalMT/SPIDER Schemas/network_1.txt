Schema Overview:

This database schema represents a social network among high school students. It consists of three tables:

**Highschooler:** Contains information about individual students.
**Friend:** Represents friendships between students.
**Likes:** Represents "like" relationships between students.


Table Descriptions:

**Highschooler:**
* ID (INT): Unique identifier for each student (primary key).
* name (TEXT): Name of the student.
* grade (INT): Grade level of the student.

**Friend:**
* student_id (INT): Foreign key referencing `Highschooler`(ID), representing one student in a friendship.
* friend_id (INT): Foreign key referencing `Highschooler`(ID), representing the other student in the friendship.
* primary key (student_id, friend_id):  Ensures that a friendship is only recorded once (no duplicates).

**Likes:**
* student_id (INT): Foreign key referencing `Highschooler`(ID), representing the student who likes another.
* liked_id (INT): Foreign key referencing `Highschooler`(ID), representing the student who is liked.
* primary key (student_id, liked_id):  Ensures that a "like" is only recorded once (no duplicates).
